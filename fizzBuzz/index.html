      This program takes a user’s input and prints the numbers from 1 to the
      number the user entered.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, for multiples of 3 it prints Fizz instead of the number and for
      the multiples of 5 it prints Buzz.
      <br />
      <br />
      For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 it prints FizzBuzz.

    // user input

    // let answer = parseInt(
    //   prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: ")
    // );

    // loop from 1 to the entered number
    // We declare a variable i and assign it 1: the initial value of the variable i in our loop (NOTE: Most of the time, programmers find themselves looping from 0. Due to the needs of our program, we’re starting from 1). The second clause, i <= answer is our condition. We want to loop until i is greater than answer. The third clause, i++, tells our loop to increment i by 1 every iteration. As a result, if the user inputs 10, this loop would print numbers 1 - 10 to the console.

    // let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));
    // for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
    //   console.log(i);
    // }

    // If the current number is divisible by 3, then print Fizz.
    // We are using the modulus operator (%) here to divide the current number by three. If you recall from a previous lesson, the modulus operator returns the remainder of a division. So if a remainder of 0 is returned from the division, it means the current number is divisible by 3.

    // let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));
    // for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
    //   if (i % 3 === 0) {
    //     console.log("Fizz");
    //   } else {
    //     console.log(i);
    //   }
    // }

    // now add buzz if the current number is divisible by 5
    // let answer = parseInt(
    //   prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: ")
    // );

    // for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
    //   if (i % 3 === 0) {
    //     console.log("Fizz");
    //   } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    //     console.log("Buzz");
    //   } else {
    //     console.log(i);
    //   }
    // }

    // We have one more subproblem to solve to complete the program: If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print FizzBuzz.

    // We’ve had to move the conditionals around a little to get it to work. The first condition now checks if i is divisible by 3 and 5 instead of checking if i is just divisible by 3. We’ve had to do this because if we kept it the way it was, it would run the first condition if (i % 3 === 0), so that if i was divisible by 3, it would print Fizz and then move on to the next number in the iteration, even if i was divisible by 5 as well.

    // With the condition if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) coming first, we check that i is divisible by both 3 and 5 before moving on to check if it is divisible by 3 or 5 individually in the else if conditions.

    // The program is now complete!
